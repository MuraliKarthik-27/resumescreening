**Resume Screening using Machine Learning**
This project focuses on automating resume screening using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to classify resumes into predefined job categories, helping recruiters quickly identify suitable candidates. The dataset consists of resumes labeled with different job roles, and the project follows a structured approach: data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training with classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports. Oversampling techniques are applied to balance the dataset, and resumes are cleaned by removing links, special characters, and unnecessary symbols to improve classification accuracy. The trained model is saved for real-time predictions, making the system efficient and scalable for HR applications.

The resources used in this project include Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib (for data processing and visualization), Scikit-learn (for ML model implementation), and Pickle (for model storage and deployment). The key steps in the workflow include data loading, category visualization, text preprocessing, feature extraction, data splitting for training and testing, classifier training (SVM and KNN), model evaluation, and saving the trained models. This resume screening system can be integrated into recruitment platforms to streamline candidate shortlisting, reducing manual effort and improving hiring efficiency.
